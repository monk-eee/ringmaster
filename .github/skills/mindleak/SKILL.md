# MindLeak

Use MindLeak's decaying Memory Plane for repository evidence and Lodestar's
durable Intent Plane for goals, coordination, governance, and completion proof.
Do not query their SQLite files directly.

## Route the Request

1. If either MCP server is unavailable, the user asks to install/configure it,
   or registration is suspect, follow [setup](./references/setup.md).
2. If both planes are available, open one shared session and verify storage as
   described below.
3. For implementation, investigation, planning, coordination, or handoff, follow
   [the working loop](./references/workflow.md).
4. If a claim, evidence bundle, or conformance check is refused, or a push
   reports that the work will not certify, see
   [troubleshooting](./references/troubleshooting.md).
5. For a simple status question, use the smallest read-only tools that answer it;
   do not claim work or write knowledge merely because the tools are available.

## Session Invariant

- Mint one random 128-bit lowercase hexadecimal `session_id` per chat/session.
- Call `open_session` on both planes with that exact token. Reuse it for every
  identity-bearing call; the human-readable agent label is not an identity.
- Declare `branch`, `head_sha`, `base`, and `dirty` when they are known. The
  servers record declarations and never inspect Git themselves.
- Call `storage_status` on both planes after setup. Their `repository_id` values
  must match and their database paths must share one repository directory.
- Never print or persist credentials in a session declaration or tool evidence.

## Default Work Loop

1. Identify the concrete workspace-relative paths and symbol ids in scope.
2. Run both preflights before editing: Lodestar's live task-overlap query and
   MindLeak's decay-active `check_overlap`. Treat unknown ids as unknown, not
   clear, and a quiet impact result as "nothing recorded", not "no impact".
3. Ask Lodestar `advise` what governs the intended artifacts. Respect `review`,
   `block`, and `needs_human`; advice is evidence, not a lock bypass.
4. If work has a Lodestar task, claim it with the same paths/symbols. Renew its
   lease after each substantial step and before long validation.
5. Ground the change with deterministic evidence (`evidence_for`, impact, graph
   traversal, task scope). Semantic `recall` is optional supporting evidence,
   never the sole basis for a risky edit.
6. Make and validate the smallest principled change.
7. Write back only useful facts: changed files, meaningful executions, commits,
   and genuine architectural decisions. Never ingest secrets or noisy logs.
8. Complete a claimed task through Lodestar with validation and conformance
   evidence. Report failures even when they remain unfixed.

## Operating Rules

- MindLeak and Lodestar are local and fully useful without an LLM, embedding
  model, account, or network service.
- Keep ingestion deterministic. Optional model calls belong only to explicit
  consolidation or semantic-recall paths.
- Coordinate on overlap; do not interpret advisory checks as filesystem locks.
- Prefer the tool schema exposed by the running server over copied argument
  shapes. Product versions can add fields while preserving the workflow.
- If a tool is missing or a server identity differs from the expected build,
  stop the workflow and use the setup/troubleshooting reference.
