# Working Loop

Use this loop after both planes pass setup verification.

## 1. Open One Identity

Mint one 128-bit lowercase hexadecimal token and call `open_session` on the
Memory and Intent planes. Reuse it throughout the session. When Git facts are
available, declare branch, head SHA, expected base, and dirty state on both.

## 2. Establish Scope Before Editing

Collect concrete workspace-relative paths and stable symbol ids. Then run:

```text
lodestar.task_query(view="overlap", paths=[...], symbols=[...], session_id=...)
mindleak.check_overlap(paths=[...], symbols=[...], session_id=...)
lodestar.advise(node_ids=["artifact:<path>", "symbol:<id>", ...])
```

Interpret the results carefully:

- Lodestar reports intersections with active declared task scopes.
- MindLeak reports decay-active footprints, structural impact, prior failures,
  related intent, and ids it has never observed.
- `unknown` is not an all-clear. A quiet graph under-reports rather than guesses.
- On overlap, coordinate, serialize same-file work, narrow scope, or stop. Do
  not edit first and negotiate after the conflict.
- `advise`'s `needs_human` currently conflates two different situations in one
  disposition: no goals/constitution have ever been adopted for this
  repository (an infrastructure gap — safe to proceed with ordinary work, see
  step 3), versus this specific artifact's governance being genuinely
  ambiguous (a real stop condition). Check `lodestar_stats.active_goals`
  first: `0` means the former; a nonzero count with `needs_human` still
  returned means the latter and should stop you. A future Lodestar release
  may split this into a structured reason field
  ([monk-eee/MindLeak#447](https://github.com/monk-eee/MindLeak/issues/447)).

## 3. Join the Intent Workflow When One Exists

If the user names a task, or the request clearly belongs to an existing task,
query it before creating anything new. Claim it with the current session and
the same path/symbol scope. If there is no task, ordinary repository work may
continue without manufacturing one.

**No tool in the current MCP surface creates a Lodestar goal.** `task_create`
requires an existing `goal_id` and returns `not found` for any id that has
never been seeded; nothing auto-creates one. A fresh repository with
`lodestar_stats.active_goals == 0` has therefore never been able to reach a
Lodestar task at all — this is a repo-wide infrastructure gap, not a signal
that this particular request lacks coverage. Query once
(`task_query(view="board")` or `lodestar_stats`) to confirm zero goals
repo-wide, then proceed with ordinary work governed by the repository's own
decision-record system instead of stalling on Lodestar. Tracked upstream:
[monk-eee/MindLeak#447](https://github.com/monk-eee/MindLeak/issues/447);
revisit this note once a goal-creation/import tool ships.

Renew a held claim:

- after a build or test step;
- between files in a multi-file change;
- before a long-running command;
- whenever the next step could outlast the lease.

If a claim lapsed, use the server's explicit same-owner reclaim/recovery path;
never conceal the gap by changing identity.

## 4. Gather Evidence Proportionate to Risk

Prefer deterministic reads:

- `evidence_for` for facts and provenance about an artifact or symbol;
- `get_impact_radius` or graph traversal for likely dependents;
- task scope, governing clauses, and conformance history for intent;
- `working_set` for current session context.

Use semantic `recall` only when meaning-based discovery adds value. It may
abstain and must not replace direct inspection, exact search, or impact checks.

## 5. Change and Validate

Follow the repository's own instructions and test policy. Keep the edit within
the declared scope, renew any claim at step boundaries, and retain concrete
validation output for completion evidence.

## 6. Write Back Deliberately

For headless clients, explicitly ingest changed files after successful writes.
Record executions only when their outcome teaches a reusable fact, and never
include credentials or unfiltered sensitive output. Ingest the resulting commit
when one is created.

Use `record_architectural_decision` only for an actual design choice with a
useful decision and rationale. Routine implementation details do not become
architecture merely because the tool exists.

Treat client memory as staging, not a second durable silo:

- When writing a reusable repository fact under `/memories/repo/`, also call
  Lodestar `record_knowledge` immediately. Pass the registered `session_id`, an
  atomic statement, a stable `source_ref` including the heading when needed,
  and evidence containing the relevant artifact/symbol `nodes` or `goal`.
- Before completing or handing off, review notes written under
  `/memories/session/` and promote only reusable repository lessons the same
  way. Temporary plans, stale measurements, secrets, and raw command output stay
  scratch.
- Do not copy global `/memories/*.md` preferences into a repository ledger.
- A sourced write is complete only when the reply says `surfaces: true`. On an
  edit, reuse the same `source_ref`; Lodestar supersedes its prior lesson. On a
  deletion, call the existing attributed `retire_knowledge` with that
  `source_ref`; it detaches only the deleted note and retires the lesson after
  its final source disappears.

Report how many memory lessons were promoted and how many remained scratch. A
final answer that mentions writing repo/session memory but never records or
explicitly rejects its durable candidates has not finished the write-back step.

Promote expiring proven signals only through the cross-plane candidate and
promotion tools; do not manually turn one session's guess into durable knowledge.

## 7. Complete or Hand Off

For claimed work:

1. Assemble the changed artifacts, validations, and relevant evidence window.
2. Run the exposed conformance check for the task and current session.
3. Transition to complete with the evidence/check payload required by the
   running server schema.
4. If the verdict requires review, a waiver, or a human decision, report that
   state honestly instead of declaring completion.

For unfinished work, pause or release through Lodestar and leave a durable
reason. For same-file successors, complete the first task before the next owner
claims it; symbol scopes are not text locks.

Finish by reporting what changed, validation results, remaining gaps, task
state, and any follow-up addressed to another agent or a human.
